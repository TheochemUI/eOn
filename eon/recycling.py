class SB_Recycling:
    """ Constructs a super-basin recycling object.
        The basic methods this undergoes are as follows:

        *First, determine whether this is a continuation of a previous recycling effort.
        *If it is a continuation, simply read in the metadata, and be ready to make suggestions
            for saddles from where we left off previously.
        *If it is a new recycling process, first determine whether or not we just left a superbasin.
        *Then, if we did just leave a superbasin, obtain the list of states we will be recycling from,
            (the list of states in the superbasin which was just exited)
        *Next, make educated guesses about what the corresponding states in the new superbasin should look like.
        *Then, using the states in the exited superbasin, find the process for each which leads to the corresponding state
            in the new superbasin.
        *Use the StateList object to make an actual state object of the corresponding states.
        *Finally, it is ready to begin making saddle-search suggestions, using the corresponding pairs
            of states, one from the old superbasin and its corresponding state in the new superbasin.
        *In either case, this will use "Recycling" to actually generate the suggestions for each state pair.

        previous_state - the state object just moved from
