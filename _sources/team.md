### Related software and collaborators

The development of eOn has been influenced and supported by the following key
collaborators and groups, many of which came together for the
[CECAM-LTS-MAP](https://github.com/CECAM-LTS-MAP) workshop:

- The [MAMASMIAS consortium](https://mammasmias.gitlab.io/), represented by [Dr.
  Miha Gunde](https://github.com/mgoonde), has had a major impact on recent
  versions of the code, particularly in improving its interoperability.[^1]

Discussions on the software's architecture have been advanced by our
collaborators in Canada:

- [Prof. Laurent Béland](https://www.laurentkarimbeland.com/) (Queen's
  University, Kingston) led strategic discussions on the design of KMC
  algorithms and provided direct support for the project by funding Rohit
  Goswami's development work for a quarter in 2025 towards combining
  disparate KMC codes[^2] .

    - The k-ART[^3]  group of [Prof. Normand
      Mousseau](https://phys.umontreal.ca/repertoire-departement/professeurs/professeur/in/in14441/sg/Normand%20Mousseau/)
      (University of Montreal) contributed to discussions on project's
      high-level design.

Rohit also acknowledges funding support from
[lab-COSMO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cosmo/), for supporting
[metatomic](https://docs.metatensor.org/metatomic/latest/overview.html) models
in eOn, in particular [Dr. Guillaume Fraux](https://guillaume.fraux.fr/) and
[Prof. Michele Ceriotti](https://people.epfl.ch/michele.ceriotti?lang=en).
