# User Guide

Here we collect a brief introduction to each algorithm, with curated references
for more information along with the  configuration settings as implemented
within `eOn`.

Each of the sections and methods may be included in the configuration file with
the appropriate section header.

## Overview

The `eOn` program can run the following methods or tasks to explore the
configuration space of molecular systems and to accelerate the simulation of
their dynamics over long times. To run `eOn`, a configuration file must be generated
using the options specified in the documentation. Each section header is denoted
by square brackets, and is followed by the key/value pairs. For example, to set
the *job_type* key of the *[Main]* section to the value *process_search*, your
configuration file would include the lines:

```{code-block} toml
[Main]
job_type = "process_search"
```

```{versionchanged} 3.1_TBA
The format for the configuration files were changed from INI [to TOML](https://toml.io/en/), where this causes relevant user changes it will be highlighted.
- The default file is now `config.toml` instead of `config.ini`
```

There are specific options for each method, and a set of general options which
are shared between methods. Examples of these general options include
specificion of the interatomic potential and the parameters for doing structural
optimizations and comparisons.

```{note}
As of version 2.0 onwards, we recommend using dedicated workflow management tools (like [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) or [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) or [Fireworks](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks)) instead of using `eOn` to generate submission scripts.
```
````

EON is designed to run in serial on one computer or in parallel using a
communicator to send jobs from a server to clients and receive the results back.
Several parallelization schemes have been implemented, including local
communication through files, cluster communication via a queuing system or via
mpi.

Methods run in parallel are broken up by the eon server into tasks which
are run by client program. The server then compiles the information sent back
by the clients in a way that can be used by the sampling or dynamics methods.

## Potentials

Some of the potentials require additional installation and setup, which are
described in the subsequent sections.
